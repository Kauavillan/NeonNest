## Welcome to [NeonNest](https://neon-nest.vercel.app)!
NeonNest is an e-commerce to prepare you to a really distant but imminent future. <br><br>
With the unstoppable advance of the technology, you can't be too careful when it comes to self safety. Everybody will be a potential enemy, including the government, so any weapon or gadget to keep you alive for some more days is unpriceable. <br>
Here, you can get anything! From standard skates to invisible cloaks, plasma weapons and robot animals. Everything with the guarantee of the best prices and most height-end technologies that still are going to be invented. <br><br>
**All products will be shipped as soon as the cyberpunk era begins (we estimate it will take about of 250 years if humanity remains alive).** <br>
**To avoid death issues, we will contact the customer when it's about 50 years until the product is shipped.**

# About the website
Everything works on front-end, using Next.js, TypeScript and Sass, plus some other packages to implement cool features. <br><br>

Almost all images were created using [Leonardo.ai](https://leonardo.ai) and [Chat GPT](https://chat.openai.com) generated all the products custom description. <br>

The website allows you to do almost everything a common e-commerce would, so it's possible to buy products, add them to cart, uptate the cart, check the shipping fare, and much more. You might miss the products stars and reviews. We really wanted to implement them, but we had no customers to review, since the products were not released yet ðŸ˜¢. <br><br>
